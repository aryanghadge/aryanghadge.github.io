## About Me
Hi! My name is Aryan. I work as a Flight Software Engineer at Karman Drones. This involves developing and testing software for our autonomous aerial vehicles that are used for various applications, such as mapping and surveillance.
I graduated from Purdue University with a BS in Aerospace Engineering in 2022, where I learned the fundamentals of aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and control systems. 
I'm skilled in Python, C/C++, MATLAB, ROS/ROS2. I'm Familiar with Linux OS and Embedded programming. My core skillset lies in developing autopilot flight codes and ground control station software. 
I'm passionate about the future of drones and advancing the limits of UAS autonomy is something I'm deeply interested in.
