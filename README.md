Take a chance on me.

I know those words are wrought with uncertainty. I know you’ve taken chances before, and they have flopped and floundered and left you high and dry. I know you are scared to start again after everything before this has failed you—I am, too. But baby, if I have to fail again, it is you I want to go down in flames with. I know that nothing ever works out, but if it does, it would be this. It would be here. It would be you and me and whatever this fire is between us.

Take a chance on me. Because the timing’s always going to be wrong and the stars are never going to align, but I would break every clock in this city. I’d stop every star from shining if it meant that, for one afternoon, we could cast all that aside and give in. Give in to the complete impossibility that something could work here despite everything that stands in the way. Give in to how your touch makes me shiver, and your words make my mind race and reel. Give in to the improbability that this is going to work out or end well or fall into place exactly as we’d hoped or that any of it will be even half worth it in the end. Give in to senselessness. Give in to you, finally giving in to me.
